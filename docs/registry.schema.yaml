      k6 Extension Registry.

      The k6 extension registry contains the most important properties of registered extensions.

      Properties of the registered k6 extension.

      Only those properties of the extensions are registered, which either cannot be detected automatically, or delegation to the extension is not allowed.

      Properties that are available using the repository manager API are intentionally not registered.

      The string like properties that are included in the generated Grafana documentation are intentionally not accessed via the API of the repository manager. It is not allowed to inject arbitrary text into the Grafana documentation site without approval. Therefore, these properties are registered (eg `description`)
    properties:
      module:
        type: string
        description: |
          The extension's go module path.

          This is the unique identifier of the extension.
          More info about module paths: https://go.dev/ref/mod#module-path

          The extension has no name property, the module path or part of it can be used as the extension name. For example, using the first two elements of the module path after the host name, the name `grafana/xk6-dashboard` can be formed from the module path `github.com/grafana/xk6-dashboard`. This is typically the repository owner name and the repository name in the repository manager.

          The extension has no URL property, a URL can be created from the module path that refers to the extension within the repository manager.
        examples:
          - github.com/grafana/xk6-dashboard
          - github.com/szkiba/xk6-top

          List of JavaScript import paths registered by the extension.

          Currently, paths must start with the prefix `k6/x/`.

          The extensions used by k6 scripts are automatically detected based on the values specified here, therefore it is important that the values used here are consistent with the values registered by the extension at runtime.
        examples:
          - ["k6/x/csv", "k6/x/csv/stream"]
          - ["k6/x/toml"]
      outputs:
        type: array
        items:
          type: string

          The extensions used by k6 scripts are automatically detected based on the values specified here, therefore it is important that the values used here are consistent with the values registered by the extension at runtime.
        examples:

          Repository metadata.

          Metadata provided by the extension's git repository manager. Repository metadata are not registered, they are queried at runtime using the repository manager API.
      official:
        type: boolean
        default: "false"
        description: |
          Officially supported extension flag.

          The `true` value of the `official` flag indicates that the extension is officially supported by Grafana.

          Extensions owned by the `grafana` GitHub organization are not officially supported by Grafana by default. There are several k6 extensions owned by the `grafana` GitHub organization, which were created for experimental or example purposes only. The `official` flag is needed so that officially supported extensions can be distinguished from them.
      cloud:
        type: boolean
        default: "false"
        description: |
          Cloud-enabled extension flag.

          The `true` value of the `cloud` flag indicates that the extension is also available in the Grafana k6 cloud.

          The use of certain extensions is not supported in a cloud environment. There may be a technological reason for this, or the extension's functionality is meaningless in the cloud.

          The URL is provided by the repository manager and can be displayed in a browser.
      homepage:
        type: string
        default: ""
        description: |
          The URL to the project homepage.

          If no homepage is set, the value is the same as the url property.

          Repository topics.

          Topics make it easier to find the repository. It is recommended to set the xk6 topic to the extensions repository.

          The repository's git tags.

          States of the git repository marked with tags can be reproduced. Versions are also tags, they must meet certain format requirements.
      versions:
        type: array
        items:
          type: string
        description: |
          List of supported versions.

          Versions are tags whose format meets the requirements of semantic versioning. Version tags often start with the letter `v`, which is not part of the semantic version.
