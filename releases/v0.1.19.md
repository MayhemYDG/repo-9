k6registry `v0.1.19` is here ðŸŽ‰!

This is an internal maintenance release.

**simplify responsibility***

- only use `registry.schema.json` instead of owning it, `registry.schema.json` source moved to `grafana/k6-extension-registry` repository
- only implement `openapi.yaml` and not own it, `openapi.yaml` source moved to `grafana/k6-extension-registry` repository
