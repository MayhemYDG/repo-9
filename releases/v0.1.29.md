k6registry `v0.1.29` is here ðŸŽ‰!

This is an internal maintenance release.

**Generate catalog and registry at the same time**

During customization, it is often necessary to generate both catalog and registry. These two outputs can now be generated simultaneously, with a single `k6registry` run.

The `--catalog` flag now specifies the location of the generated catalog.
