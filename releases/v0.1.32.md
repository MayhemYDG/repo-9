k6registry `v0.1.32` is here ðŸŽ‰!

This is an internal maintenance release.

**xk6 topic not required for internal extensions**

The internal linter previously expected the `xk6` topic to be set on the extensions repository. In the case of internal (albeit public) extensions, it would not be a good idea to use the `xk6` topic, because that would cause them to appear in the GitHub topic search.

The internal linter now does not expect the xk6 topic to be set for extensions that do not have `oss` in their `products` property. That is, in the case of extensions that cannot be used in Grafana k6, the use of the `xk6` topic is not required.
