k6registry `v0.1.26` is here ðŸŽ‰!

This is an internal maintenance release.

**Fix change detection**

The use of the `out` parameter was a prerequisite for change detection in GitHub Actions mode. If the `api` parameter is used, the `out` parameter is not required. As a result, when using the `api` parameter, change detection did not work until now. This issue is fixed in this release. Change detection now works when using the `api` parameter in GitHub Actions mode.
