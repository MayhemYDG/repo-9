k6registry `v0.1.18` is here ðŸŽ‰!

This is an internal maintenance release.

**extension catalog support***

The registry and the catalog contain the same elements, only in different containers. The registry is a list (array), and the catalog is a map (object).

The consequence of this is that the versions property is moved from the repository object to the extension object.

During the generation of registry subsets, catalogs are also generated for the subsets (e.g. cloud.json and cloud-catalog.json).
