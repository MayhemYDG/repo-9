k6registry `v0.1.6` is here 🎉!

This is an internal maintenance release.

The only change is that in GitHub action mode, the change can be indicated by comparing the output to a reference output. The reference output URL can be passed in the `ref` action parameter. The output variable `changed` will be `true` or `false` depending on whether the output has changed or not compared to the reference output.
