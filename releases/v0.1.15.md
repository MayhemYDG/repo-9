k6registry `v0.1.15` is here ðŸŽ‰!

This is an internal maintenance release.

**Fix file/directory permissions**

`golangci-lint` forces the file permission to be `0o600` and the directory permission to be `0o750`. When k6registry runs as a GitHub action, it runs as the root user, so accessing the generated files from the rest of the workflow is problematic.

In the case of generated files, now the permission set to `0o644`, in the case of a direcotry to `0o755`.
