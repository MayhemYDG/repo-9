k6registry `v0.1.21` is here ðŸŽ‰!

This is an internal maintenance release.

**Retry git pull on error**

In the git working directory, the file permissions are changed to make the cache persistent in GitHub action mode. As a consequence, the git pull operation will fail (if permissions have actually been changed).

To fix this, if the pull operation fails, the pull operation is repeated after a forced checkout operation.
