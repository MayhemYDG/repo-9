k6registry `v0.1.31` is here ðŸŽ‰!

This is an internal maintenance release.

**Sort the versions property**

The tags queried via the repository manager API happen to be in good order, the most recently created tag is at the beginning of the list. However, this does not guarantee that the list is always ordered according to semantic versioning.

After loading and detecting the versions of the extension during registry generation, the versions property now sorted according to semantic versioning.
