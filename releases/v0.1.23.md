k6registry `v0.1.23` is here ðŸŽ‰!

This is an internal maintenance release.

**Fix cache saving issue**

The GitHub workflow is running with user id `1001` and group id `127`. The k6registry docker container runs with the default user id in debian.  As a consequence, the cache directory created under XDG_CACHE_HOME fails to save.

The solution is to use the same user id and group id as the GitHub workflow in the k6registry docker container (user id: `1001`, group id: `127`).
